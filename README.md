# Tool
This is work to define the tooling across the API space.

The goal of this conversation is to understand:

- What do specs need?
- What do tools need?
- What do service providers need?

Acknowledging that there is a producer & consumer dimension:

- From Inside
- From Outside

Focusing on the areas of operations that matter the most:

- Parsers
- Generators
- Test Suites
- Documentation
- Code Generation

Looking across serveral areas that elevate tooling:

- Operational
- Informational
- Educational
- Marketing
